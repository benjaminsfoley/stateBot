# StateBot: Rethinking State Management with Large Language Models

State management is a cornerstone of modern web development. From tracking user authentication to orchestrating multi-step forms, how we model and transition between states largely determines the reliability and maintainability of our applications. 

Yet, traditional state management approaches often rely on explicitly defined transitions - a finite set of paths from one state to another. This works well for simple cases but can become unwieldy as application complexity grows.

What if we could model state more semantically, based on facts about our application rather than predetermined transitions?

## The Concept: Fact-Based State Determination

StateBot is an experimental state management library for SvelteKit that explores a more declarative approach to state management. Rather than defining explicit transitions between states, you define:

1. The possible states your application can be in
2. Facts that qualify something as being in each state

A large language model then acts as the deterministic decision-maker, analyzing the current facts and determining the appropriate state.

This approach shifts from "how do I get from state A to state B?" to "what facts about my application determine its current state?" - a subtle but powerful change in perspective.

## How It Works

The core mechanism is straightforward:

```typescript
// Define your states and qualifying facts
type AuthState = 'unauthenticated' | 'authenticated' | 'expired';

const authStateBot = createStateBot<AuthState>({
  provider: 'claude',
  apiKey: CLAUDE_API_KEY,
  states: {
    authenticated: [
      'User has valid JWT token',
      'Token is not expired',
      'Token passes signature validation'
    ],
    unauthenticated: [
      'User has no JWT token',
      'JWT token is missing'
    ],
    expired: [
      'JWT token has expired',
      'Token timestamp is in the past'
    ]
  }
});

// Add facts as they become known
authStateBot.addFact('User has valid JWT token');
authStateBot.addFact('Token is not expired');

// Subscribe to state changes
authStateBot.subscribe(state => {
  console.log('Current state:', state.currentState);
  // â†’ 'authenticated'
});
```

When facts change, StateBot consults the language model, which evaluates the facts against the defined states and returns the most appropriate state along with a confidence score.

## Technical Decisions

Several key decisions shaped StateBot's development:

### 1. Using LLMs as Deterministic Decision-Makers

Language models excel at understanding semantic relationships and making nuanced determinations based on textual descriptions. This makes them well-suited for evaluating a set of facts against potential states.

While this could be accomplished with rule engines or complex conditional logic, language models provide a more flexible interface that can handle ambiguity and nuance in a way that feels natural to developers.

### 2. Pub-Sub Architecture

StateBot implements the publisher-subscriber pattern through Svelte's built-in store mechanism, making integration seamless in SvelteKit applications while enabling reactive UI updates.

### 3. Performance Optimizations

Several optimizations ensure practical usability:

- **Caching**: Results are cached based on fact combinations to minimize API calls
- **Debouncing**: Multiple fact changes are batched to prevent excessive API calls
- **Typescript Integration**: Strong typing ensures state definitions remain consistent

### 4. Provider Flexibility

Support for multiple LLM providers (Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT) allows developers to choose based on their specific requirements, existing API access, or preferred model characteristics.

## Use Cases

StateBot works particularly well for:

### 1. Authentication Flows

Authentication often involves multiple factors that determine a user's state. With StateBot, you can model authentication states based on facts like token validity, session status, and account verification.

### 2. Multi-Step Forms and Wizards

Rather than tracking form completion through counters or flags, StateBot allows you to model form states based on field completions, validation statuses, and user interactions.

### 3. Application Feature States

Applications often have features with complex state requirements. StateBot makes it easier to model these states based on user permissions, data availability, and system conditions.

## Beyond Implementation: Rethinking State

What makes this approach interesting goes beyond implementation details. It invites us to think about state more abstractly:

1. **Declarative Over Imperative**: Describing what constitutes a state rather than how to reach it
2. **Facts as First-Class Concepts**: Making application facts explicit rather than implicit
3. **Semantic State Determination**: Using natural language to bridge the gap between human understanding and program execution

## Challenges and Considerations

This approach isn't without challenges:

1. **API Dependency**: Relying on external LLM services introduces potential points of failure
2. **Determinism**: Ensuring consistent state determination requires careful prompt engineering
3. **Performance Costs**: API calls add latency compared to client-side state management

We've addressed these through caching, optimistic updates, and fallback mechanisms, but they remain important considerations for production use.

## Looking Forward

StateBot represents an early exploration into how language models might reshape fundamental programming paradigms. It sits at an interesting intersection of traditional state management, rule engines, and natural language processing.

Future directions might include:

1. Local model integration for reduced latency and offline capability
2. Advanced state prediction for proactive user experiences
3. Hybrid approaches combining traditional state machines with semantic determination

## Try It Yourself

StateBot is open source and available on NPM. If you're interested in exploring this approach to state management, you can install it with:

```bash
npm install statebot
```

We've designed it to be simple to integrate with existing SvelteKit projects, with only a few lines of code needed to get started. The repository includes comprehensive documentation and examples to help you explore.

We're interested in how developers might apply this approach to their own projects and would love to hear your thoughts and experiences.
